PROJECT: E-COMMERCE WITH REACT.

Development of an e-commerce where users will register, log in, view products and create orders using the e-commerce API from the 1st Backend Project.




## Installation

Install my project with npm.
We start the project with React installing vite

```bash
  npm create vite@latest
```

We installed the VSC extension for React. It will help us a lot.

```bash
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
```

We will install the dependencies that we need for this project.

```bash
  npm install sass
  npm install react-router-dom@6
  npm i axios  
  npm i antd
```

To avoid having to start the project all the time.

```bash
  npm run dev
```
If all goes well, the following will appear:

```bash
> web-news@0.0.0 dev
> vite

VITE v4.3.9  ready in 1102 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```






## Description

What we will develop in the project will be the following:

The minimum components used are:

    Register
    Login
    Home
    Products
    Cart
    Profile. Profile view with the data of the logged in user and their orders
    Headers
    Footers

Implementation of a search bar to be able to obtain the products by name.

Implementation of an Admin view that will only be visible if the user is logged in as the administrator, and that will allow him to create, delete and update products.

React Router implementation on the page.

We will use SASS and CONTEXT to finish the project.
